# HealthChain-Backend

Backend for Final Year Project - Health Chain

Health Chain is an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system which uses blockchain technology to store medical records in a transparent, tamper-proof and trustworthy fashion. The medical records are based on Patient and GP interactions. To ensure the records are kept safe, the records are encrypted using an encryption service before they are stored. To give control to the patient, there is a trust mechanism in place which only allows trusted GP’s to view a patients medical records.

## Getting Started

- Open the HealthChain application using an IDE such as IntelliJ
- Ensure you have MongoDB installed
